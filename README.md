Arduino Based IR-Blaster to TURN ON/OFF DIAKIN_AC- Using Keycard Detection to switch

## Contribute

There are several ways to contribute to IR BLASTER development. You can contribute to the repository by doing:

* Pull requests (fixes, enhancements, new features... are very welcome)
* Documentation (I reckon I'm bad at it)
* Testing (filing issues or help resolving them, they take a lot of time and sometimes I don't have the required hardware to test them all)

And of course you can always buy me a beer, coffee, tea,... via the donation button below.
